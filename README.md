## 2. Capstone Project 
**boopd** is our capstone project at LEARN Academy. Students work in a small group to create a full-stack web application. Acting as a development team, the students use agile and scrum project management techniques to plan, wireframe, code, and deploy an application.

```
Every snoot deserves a boop.
```
*We* at KYAC Inc. have seen an increase of de-homed animals and struggling families during the pandemic. It is our vision to be part of the solution. 

*With* our pet-adoption-resource boopd, we connect struggling animals with benevolent humans who wish to care for them in these trying times. 

*We* present to you a nation-wide resource to find the animal that belongs in your home, or find the home that is worthy of your beloved pet that you can no longer care for.
