      <h3>WHAT WE DO</h3>
      <p>We at KYAC Inc. have seen an increase of de-homed animals and struggling families during the pandemic. It is our vision to be part of the solution. With our pet-adoption-resource boopd, we connect struggling animals with benevolent humans who wish to care for them in these trying times. We present to you a nation-wide resource to find the animal that belongs in your home, or find the home that is worthy of your beloved pet that you can no longer care for.</p>
